# skip-chan

This is a modified version of the skip channel example in the [Concurrent Haskell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1996/01/concurrent-haskell.pdf) paper.
It adds `extendSkipChan`, `extendSkipChan_`, `extendSkipChanMasked`, `extendSkipChanMasked_`.

Note that it is not published, nor actively documented or maintained for the time being.
